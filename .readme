  - Creating New one-off Payments via redirect to Hosted Payment Forms
  - Creating managed recurring transactions (initial + recurring) via redirect to secure payment forms
  - Settling / capturing or cancelling authorisations from within Magento
  - Cancelling ongoing recurring transactions from within Magento
  - Crediting / refunding transactions from within Magento
  - Viewing order and transaction details from within Magento
  - Event notifications from the IPGPAY gateway are consumed and displayed within Magento
  - Transaction synchronisation between the IPGPAY gateway and Magento

The plugin is delivered as a ZIP package for installation in the merchants Magento instance. The Magento plugin is only available for use with IPGPAY’s Secure Payment Forms.  At present there is no support for the Web Services API.
